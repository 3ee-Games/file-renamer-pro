## Usage

You can pass in arguments to the program as follows:

```shell
file-renamer-pro -p [path] -n [prepend] -a [append] -f [filter] --keep-case
```

Here is the explanation of the arguments:

- `-p [path]` : Path to the files to be renamed.
- `-n [prepend]` : Name to prepend to the filename.
- `-a [append]` : Name to append to the filename.
- `-f [filter]` : Amount of filtering used in renaming files: 
    - `0` = Removes only spaces
    - `1` = Removes spaces and parentheses (DEFAULT)
    - `2` = Removes spaces and all special characters
    - `3` = Removes all numbers
    - `4` = Generates a GUID as filename
- `--keep-case` : This flag will keep the case of the file name.

### Detailed Usage

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `file-renamer-pro -p {path}` | Specify a path; if not provided, you'll be prompted to enter one |
| `file-renamer-pro -f {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` | Select a renaming filter |
| `file-renamer-pro -n {name}` | Prepend a custom text to the file name |
| `file-renamer-pro -a {name}` | Append a custom text to the file name |
| `file-renamer-pro --keep-case` | Use this flag to maintain the original file name's case |

#### Basic Usage with Default Settings

```shell
file-renamer-pro -p c:\myfolder\assets
```

This command renames all files within `myfolder\assets` using the default renaming filter.

#### Specifying a Renaming Filter

```shell
file-renamer-pro -f 2 -p c:\myfolder\assets
```

This command renames all files within `myfolder\assets`, removing all special characters.

Here is what each filter level does:

| Filter Command | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `file-renamer-pro -f 0` | Removes all spaces |
| `file-renamer-pro -f 1` | Removes all spaces and parentheses (default) |
| `file-renamer-pro -f 2` | Removes all spaces and special characters |
| `file-renamer-pro -f 3` | Removes all numbers |
| `file-renamer-pro -f 4` | Renames all files as GUIDs |

#### Prepend Custom Text

```shell
file-renamer-pro -f 3 -n hi_ -p c:\myfolder\assets
```

This command renames all files within `myfolder\assets`, removing all numbers. All file names are prepended with "hi_" (e.g., hi_testImage.png).

#### Append Custom Text

```shell
file-renamer-pro -f 3 -a _bye -p c:\myfolder\assets
```

This command renames all files within `myfolder\assets`, removing all numbers. All file names are appended with "_bye" (e.g., testImage_bye.png).
